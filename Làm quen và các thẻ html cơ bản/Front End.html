    <b> Front-End Developer </b>
<p>
    A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web
    applications.
</p>
<p>
    The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to
    how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works.
</p>
<p>
    You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.
    The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript.
